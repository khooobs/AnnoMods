This mod adds to the game:
- 3 new locomotive models
- new variants of trains: passenger (tourist), freight train
- new variants for RailwayHall Large building from DLC Industrial Pack for passengers / tourists (use Shift + V)

It also unlocks an unused vanilla freight car and changes the composition of the default train by mixing it with oil cars.

Railway platforms have been extended including RailwayHall Large, Guard House (use Shift+V). They match Jakob's "Railway Stations" mod from "Industrial Cities".

Unfortunately, the passenger train behaves like a freight train and enters the port, so if it bothers you and you don't want new trainsets, but only locomotive models, comment or remove the line in the assets.xml file: <Include File="./trains.include.xml"/>

The Industrial Pack DLC is required for railway structures.

Compatibility:

Full for "Railway Stations (Jakob)" mod. The locomotives fit and complement Jakob's lineup of great models - I recommend using this mod.

Partial for "Train-Stations and Hotels". It's fine to use station buildings to build a separate network, but this mod replaces the default train, so mixed trains and the default vanilla skin won't work.
