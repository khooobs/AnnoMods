# New World Downtown

- Like the Downtown mod from Lion053, this mod adds 3x3-sized building variations for public services, institutions, post office and hotel in the New World.
- They are intended to be built in a block between residences to form a lively downtown or to cover small (leftover) areas where the larger original would be a waste of precious space.

## Properties

- Public service ranges are lower than their larger originals.
- Institutions have a slightly lower influence distance and you can only mobilize 2 instead of 3 special resolver units.
- The tiny hotel can accomodate 1/3 of the amount of tourists a vanilla hotel can accomodate.
- Construction and maintenance costs reflect their later unlocks
- All other values are inherited from their originals

## Menu

- "Obrero" category, next to Boxing Arena building
- "Public Services" category, next to Boxing Arena building

## Unlock

- The unlock starts at 1.000 obrero for all building types which are originally available at this level.
- For non-dlc owners, the post office and advanced institutions can not be built.
- For non New World Tourism mod owners, the hotel cannot be built.

## Includes

- Market
- Boxing Arena
- Church
- Post Office
- Fire Department with 2 skins
- Advanced Fire Department with 2 skins
- Police Station with 2 skins
- Advanced Police Station with 2 skins
- Hospital with 2 skins

- Hotel with 4 skins (with New World Tourism Compatibility)

### Possibles future updates

- New skins (for market and boxing arena)
- School (New World School compatibility)
- University
- Bank
- Members Club
- Theatre

## Compatibility

- Should be compatible with all other mods, since it does not alter, replace or remove anything vanilla.

Thanks to Lion053's original Downtown mod, which inspired me to port it to this region.
