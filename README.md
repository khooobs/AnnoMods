## New World Downtown

- Like the Downtown mod from Lion053, this mod adds 3x3-sized building variations for public services, institutions, post office and hotel in the New World.
- They are intended to be built in a block between residences to form a lively downtown or to cover small (leftover) areas where the larger original would be a waste of precious space.
- The mod is a kind of tribute to Lion, for his release of the original mod.
